# My TouchBar. My rules

My the idea is to create the program like a platform for plugins for customization TouchBar. I very like BTT and a full custom TouchBar. And I want to create it. And it's my the first Swift project for MacOS :)

### Roadmap
- [x] Create the first prototype with TouchBar in Storyboard
- [x] Put in stripe menu on startup the application
- [ ] Find how to simulate real buttons like brightness, volume, night shift and etc.
- [ ] First the weather plugin
- [ ] Create the same panel like in my [BTT preset](https://github.com/Toxblh/btt-touchbar-preset)
- [ ] Find how to open full-screen TouchBar without the cross and stripe menu
- [ ] Find how to add haptic feedback
- [ ] Refactoring the application on packages (AppleScript, JavaScript? and Swift?)
